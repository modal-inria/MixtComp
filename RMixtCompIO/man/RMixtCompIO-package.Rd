\description{
MixtComp (Mixture Composer) is a model-based clustering package for mixed data originating from the Modal team (Inria Lille).

It has been engineered around the idea of easy and quick integration of all new univariate models,
under the conditional independence assumption.
Five basic models (Gaussian, Multinomial, Poisson, Weibull, NegativeBinomial) are implemented, as well as two advanced
models (Func_CS and Rank_ISR).
MixtComp has the ability to natively manage missing data (completely or by interval). MixtComp is used as an R package,
but its internals are coded in C++ using state of the art libraries for faster computation.
This package contains the minimal R interface of the C++ library.

\details{
The main function is \link{rmcMultiRun} that runs a SEM algorithm to learn a mixture model.
