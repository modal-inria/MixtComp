Description: Mixture Composer <https://github.com/modal-inria/MixtComp> is a project to build mixture models with
    heterogeneous data sets and partially missing data management.
    It includes models for real, categorical, counting, functional and ranking data.
    This package contains the minimal R interface of the C++ 'MixtComp' library.
