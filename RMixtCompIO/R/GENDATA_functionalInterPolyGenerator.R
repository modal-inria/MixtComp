# Generate a functional observation using an interpolating polynomial instead of the generating model.
# This allows for a little more flexibility and convenience in specifying data than functionalGenerator
# which is currently bugged anyway.
#
# @param param A structure describing the points by which the interpolating polynomial is supposed to go through.
# @return The generated observation as a string.
# @examples
