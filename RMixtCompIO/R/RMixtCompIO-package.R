#' @description
#' MixtComp (Mixture Composer) is a model-based clustering package for mixed data originating from the Modal team (Inria Lille).
#'
#' It has been engineered around the idea of easy and quick integration of all new univariate models,
#' under the conditional independence assumption.
#' Five basic models (Gaussian, Multinomial, Poisson, Weibull, NegativeBinomial) are implemented, as well as two advanced
#' models (Func_CS and Rank_ISR).
#' MixtComp has the ability to natively manage missing data (completely or by interval). MixtComp is used as an R package,
#' but its internals are coded in C++ using state of the art libraries for faster computation.
#' This package contains the minimal R interface of the C++ library.
#'
#'
#' @details
#' The main function is \link{rmcMultiRun} that runs a SEM algorithm to learn a mixture model.
